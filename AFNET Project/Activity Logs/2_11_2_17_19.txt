Working on outline for eTool (Deliverable 2 in SOW) - finish this weekend

Current to do

Download install_github("nik01010/dashboardthemes")
Create fake data for dashbaord (may not be a fineal deliverable)

Outline (done)
Add link on jump page to eTool outline - add after pushing to github


gt library finally installed, try out, would be great for current or future job.

send email to Mimi (done)
Another to Ruth (done)

Summarize eTool features (once I get the green light)

Get to work on making dashboard for supervisors (once I get the green light) - would also really need
to play around with the eTool to alter the original data

Turn the selected cells into an input (maybe)

Make mobile friendly UI (eventually)

Post another app for mobile (try out the miniUI library, also see if flexdashboards has a mobile 
chunk setting) (eventually)

See examples of shinyBS - has more settings - not promising
shinyjs - incredible package (much better UI experience and ability
to really customize the behavior of the UI) contact the author dean@attalitech.com
website https://deanattali.com/aboutme/
shinytoastr - use to give the user feedback
Make professional wesbite (eventually)





Eventually - discuss long term and their past postings for web developer type positions with fatima
