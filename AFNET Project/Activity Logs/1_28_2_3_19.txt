Made eTool dev repository private, added collaborators, sent Mimi recept, added everyone to private
eTool dev repository as collaborators, left the final report and progress reports repos as public
since nothing sensitive and worth showing outsiders
Will need the OK for the email list attached, then I will send the sign in page link to them,
they will need to sign up for an account at that page (encourage them to use the same email as for 
calendar invites), then when I add them as a collaborator they will be sent an email asking if they
want to be a collaborator, then they will be able to see ALL the contents of the page, also helpful
once I set a provate repo for shinyapps since github account (or gmail) are accepted authentication 
methods (be sure I send her all the accessible links to include in the calenar invite)
Went through the equipment inventory from Ruth that she received from Biologic Solutions, could be useful
if these are in the actual Cameroon data, however, is this all the information they have about these
equipment? Nothing other than type, do they have service dates? Or perhaps this is just info they don't
have? I would really like to know how specific their data is.
